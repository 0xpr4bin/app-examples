# Examples for Miro web-plugins


In this repository, you can find [types for Miro SDK](https://github.com/miroapp/web-plugins/blob/master/miro.d.ts) and several simple examples. Descriptions and GIFs for those examples available [here](https://developers.miro.com/docs/web-plugin-examples).


To learn mode read [what web-plugins is it](https://developers.miro.com/docs/sdk) and [how to build your web-plugin](https://developers.miro.com/docs/how-to-start). 


If you like TypeScript, Webpack, and ReactJS, you can start with `plugins/plugin-boilerplate` example. It already includes these tools.

`plugins/board-cleaner` — see this example to learn how to authorize web-plugin for each user without server
